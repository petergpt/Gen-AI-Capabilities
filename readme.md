**Context:**
LLMs are surprisingly bad at brainstorming AI ideas. The reason is that they have a mix of data from pre-Gen AI and post Gen AI world, making it difficult for them to identify Gen AI specific ideas.

**Solution:**
To solve this problem, I have attempted to list a comprehensive list of capabilities that Gen AI currently has. It does not attempt to make a judgement of how well this capability would be executed by any given LLM (an impossible task), but rather gives LLMs enough context to get it to come up with a reasonable set of ideas.

**How to use:**
1. Take one of the files 'Gen_AI_Capabilities' - either a json or xml version (they are identical except for the formatting) and provide it to the LLM as context (file attachment or copy paste inside the context window).
2. Write your own prompt or use the 'brainstorm_prompt' provided to get going
3. Brainstorm away
